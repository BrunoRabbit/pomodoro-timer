Pomodoro Timer offers a custom settings for work and break time, supporting multiple work-rest cycles. 

It also has **multilingual support** (pt-BR and en-EN) and **notifications** to alert the user about cycle completion, even in the background.

In addition, it records session history and presents statistics such as completed cycles and average work and break times.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

‚ùó Note: The apk available for download is a large apk that works on most android architectures. If you want a small size apk, clone this repository and manage one using Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## üìù Packages

### Arquitecture

+ **MVVM**: It was chosen because it is more ideal for just one developer and it aims to separate the components in order to improve maintainability and testability, it separates the business logic from the user interface through three main components: Model, View and ViewModel.

### State management

+ **Provider**: Chosen to be an InheritedWidget, avoiding code repetitions and reduces boilerplate to a strict minimum. 

+ I used provider and the Observer pattern, but this pattern was made as a way of studying, as there are several state managers where they exclude the possibility of needing an Observer

### Object Oriented Design Principles

- In the **ViewModels**, I adopted dependency injection to guarantee the independence of these classes in relation to their dependent components. This approach follows the principles of **SOLID**.

+ In some classes, I implemented the **DIO** (Dependency Inversion Principle) which improves the code quality, ensuring flexibility and facilitating future maintenance.
